Quibus natura iure responderit non esse verum aliunde finem beate vivendi, a se principia rei gerendae peti; Quae enim adhuc protulisti, popularia sunt, ego autem a te elegantiora desidero. Duo Reges: constructio interrete. Tum Lucius: Mihi vero ista valde probata sunt, quod item fratri puto. Bestiarum vero nullum iudicium puto. Nihil enim iam habes, quod ad corpus referas; Deinde prima illa, quae in congressu solemus: Quid tu, inquit, huc? Et homini, qui ceteris animantibus plurimum praestat, praecipue a natura nihil datum esse dicemus?\\n\\nIam id ipsum absurdum, maximum malum neglegi. Quod ea non occurrentia fingunt, vincunt Aristonem; Atqui perspicuum est hominem e corpore animoque constare, cum primae sint animi partes, secundae corporis. Fieri, inquam, Triari, nullo pacto potest, ut non dicas, quid non probes eius, a quo dissentias. Equidem e Cn. An dubium est, quin virtus ita maximam partem optineat in rebus humanis, ut reliquas obruat?\\n\\nQuis istum dolorem timet?\\nSummus dolor plures dies manere non potest? Dicet pro me ipsa virtus nec dubitabit isti vestro beato M. Tubulum fuisse, qua illum, cuius is condemnatus est rogatione, P. Quod si ita sit, cur opera philosophiae sit danda nescio.\\n\\nEx eorum enim scriptis et institutis cum omnis doctrina liberalis, omnis historia.\\nQuod si ita est, sequitur id ipsum, quod te velle video, omnes semper beatos esse sapientes. Cum enim fertur quasi torrens oratio, quamvis multa cuiusque modi rapiat, nihil tamen teneas, nihil apprehendas, nusquam orationem rapidam coerceas. Ita redarguitur ipse a sese, convincunturque scripta eius probitate ipsius ac moribus. At quanta conantur! Mundum hunc omnem oppidum esse nostrum! Incendi igitur eos, qui audiunt, vides. Vide, ne magis, inquam, tuum fuerit, cum re idem tibi, quod mihi, videretur, non nova te rebus nomina inponere. Qui-vere falsone, quaerere mittimus-dicitur oculis se privasse; Si ista mala sunt, in quae potest incidere sapiens, sapientem esse non esse ad beate vivendum satis. At vero si ad vitem sensus accesserit, ut appetitum quendam habeat et per se ipsa moveatur, quid facturam putas?\\n\\nQuem si tenueris, non modo meum Ciceronem, sed etiam me ipsum abducas licebit.\\nStulti autem malorum memoria torquentur, sapientes bona praeterita grata recordatione renovata delectant.\\nEsse enim quam vellet iniquus iustus poterat inpune.\\nQuae autem natura suae primae institutionis oblita est?\\nVerum tamen cum de rebus grandioribus dicas, ipsae res verba rapiunt;\\nHoc est non modo cor non habere, sed ne palatum quidem.\\nVoluptatem cum summum bonum diceret, primum in eo ipso parum vidit, deinde hoc quoque alienum; Sed tu istuc dixti bene Latine, parum plane. Nam haec ipsa mihi erunt in promptu, quae modo audivi, nec ante aggrediar, quam te ab istis, quos dicis, instructum videro. Fatebuntur Stoici haec omnia dicta esse praeclare, neque eam causam Zenoni desciscendi fuisse. Non autem hoc: igitur ne illud quidem. Ratio quidem vestra sic cogit. Cum audissem Antiochum, Brute, ut solebam, cum M. An quod ita callida est, ut optime possit architectari voluptates?\\n\\nIdemne, quod iucunde?\\nHaec mihi videtur delicatior, ut ita dicam, molliorque ratio, quam virtutis vis gravitasque postulat. Sed quoniam et advesperascit et mihi ad villam revertendum est, nunc quidem hactenus; Cuius ad naturam apta ratio vera illa et summa lex a philosophis dicitur. Neque solum ea communia, verum etiam paria esse dixerunt. Sed nunc, quod agimus; A mene tu?', metadata={'source': 'sample3.txt'})]"

The larger concept of Oenotria and \"Italy\" became synonymous, and the name applied to most of Lucania as well. Before the Roman Republic\\'s expansion, the name was used by Greeks for the land between the strait of Messina and the line connecting the gulfs of Salerno and Taranto, corresponding to Calabria. The Greeks came to apply \"Italia\" to a larger region.[34] In addition to the \"Greek Italy\" in the south, historians have suggested the existence of an \"Etruscan Italy\", which consisted of areas of central Italy.[35]\\n\\nRoman Italy,\\n\\nOrigines\\n\\n[36]\\n\\nArno and\\n\\nRubicon rivers of the centre-north to the entire south.

In 509 BC, the Romans, favouring a government of the Senate and the People (SPQR), expelled the monarchy and established an oligarchic republic.\\n\\nThe Italian Peninsula, named Italia, was consolidated into a unified entity during Roman expansion, the conquest of new territories often at the expense of the other Italic tribes, Etruscans, Celts, and Greeks. A permanent association, with most of the local tribes and cities, was formed, and Rome began the conquest of Western Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. In the wake of Julius Caesar\\'s assassination in 44 BC, Rome grew into a massive empire stretching from Britain to the borders of Persia, engulfing the whole Mediterranean basin, in which Greek, Roman, and other cultures merged into a powerful civilisation. The long reign of the first emperor, Augustus, began an age of peace and prosperity. Roman Italy remained the metropole of the empire, homeland of the Romans and territory of the capital.[55]\\n\\nThe Roman Empire was among the largest in history, wielding great economical, cultural, political, and military power. At its greatest extent, it had an area of 5\\xa0million square kilometres (1.9\\xa0million square miles).[56] The Roman legacy has deeply influenced Western civilisation shaping the modern world. The widespread use of Romance languages derived from Latin, numerical system, modern Western alphabet and calendar, and the emergence of Christianity as a world religion, are among the many legacies of Roman dominance.[57]\\n\\nMiddle Ages\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nItaly in the Middle Ages\\n\\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Italy fell under the Odoacer\\'s kingdom, and was seized by the Ostrogoths.[58] Invasions resulted in a chaotic succession of kingdoms and the supposed \"dark ages\". The invasion of another Germanic tribe in the 6th century, the Lombards, reduced Byzantine presence and ended political unity of the peninsula for the next 1,300 years. The north formed the Lombard kingdom, central-south was also controlled by the Lombards, and other parts remained Byzantine.[59]\\n\\nMarco Polo, 13th-century explorer\\n\\nThe Lombard kingdom was absorbed into Francia by Charlemagne in the late 8th century and became the Kingdom of Italy.[60] The Franks helped form the Papal States. Until the 13th century, politics was dominated by relations between the Holy Roman Emperors and the Papacy, with city-states siding with the former (Ghibellines) or with the latter (Guelphs) for momentary advantage.[61] The Germanic emperor and Roman pontiff became the universal powers of medieval Europe. However, conflict over the Investiture Controversy and between Guelphs and Ghibellines ended the imperial-feudal system in the north, where cities gained independence.[62] In 1176, the Lombard League of city-states, defeated Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, ensuring their independence.\\n\\nCity-states—e.g. Milan, Florence, Venice—played a crucially innovative role in financial development by devising banking practices, and enabling new forms of social organization.[63] In coastal and southern areas, maritime republics dominated the Mediterranean and monopolised trade to the Orient. They were independent thalassocratic city-states, in which merchants had considerable power. Although oligarchical, the relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement.[64] The best-known maritime republics were Venice, Genoa, Pisa, and Amalfi.[65] Each had dominion over overseas lands, islands, lands on the Adriatic, Aegean, and Black seas, and commercial colonies in the Near East and North Africa.[66]\\n\\nItalian Navy. Clockwise, from upper left: the coat of arms of\\n\\nVenice,\\n\\nGenoa,\\n\\nPisa and\\n\\nAmalfi\\n\\nGenoa and\\n\\nVenice\\n\\nVenice and Genoa were Europe\\'s gateways to the East, and producers of fine glass, while Florence was a centre of silk, wool, banking, and jewellery. The wealth generated meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned. The republics participated in the Crusades, providing support, transport, but mostly taking political and trading opportunities.[64] Italy first felt the economic changes which led to the commercial revolution: Venice was able to sack Byzantine\\'s capital and finance Marco Polo\\'s voyages to Asia; the first universities were formed in Italian cities, and scholars such as Aquinas obtained international fame; capitalism and banking families emerged in Florence, where Dante and Giotto were active around 1300.[19] Southern Italy was divided between the Kingdom of Sicily and Kingdom of Naples.[d][67] The Black Death of 1348 killed perhaps a third of Italy\\'s population.[68]\\n\\nEarly modern period\\n\\nMain articles: \\n\\nItalian Renaissance and\\n\\nHistory of early modern Italy\\n\\nItalian states before the\\n\\nItalian Wars in 1494\\n\\nItaly was the birthplace and heart of the Renaissance during the 1400s. It marked the transition from the medieval period to the modern age. Italian polities were now regional states effectively ruled by princes, in control of trade and administration, and their courts became centres of the arts and sciences. The Italian princedoms represented the first modern states, as opposed to feudal monarchies and empires. The princedoms were led by political dynasties and merchant families, such as the Medici in Florence.[69][70] The Renaissance was fostered by the wealth accumulated by merchant cities and patronage of its dominant families.[69] The Italian Renaissance exercised a dominant influence on European art for centuries, with artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael, Giotto, Donatello, and Titian, and architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi, Andrea Palladio, and Donato Bramante.\\n\\nAfter the end of the Western Schism, newly elected Pope Martin V returned to the Papal States and restored Italy as the sole centre of Western Christianity. The Medici Bank was made the credit institution of the Papacy, and significant ties were established between the Church and new political dynasties. The Popes\\' status as elective monarchs turned conclaves and consistories into political battles, between the courts for primacy and access to the immense resources of the Church.\\n\\nLeonardo da Vinci, quintessential\\n\\nRenaissance man, in a self-portrait (\\n\\nPope Nicholas V sent forces were to defend\\n\\nConstantinople, but it was lost to the more advanced\\n\\nOttomans. This led to the migration of\\n\\nGreek scholars and texts to Italy, fuelling the rediscovery of Greek\\n\\nhumanism.\\n\\n[71]\\n\\nFederico da Montefeltro and\\n\\nPope Pius II worked to establish\\n\\nideal cities, founding\\n\\nUrbino and\\n\\nPienza.\\n\\nPico della Mirandola wrote the\\n\\nOration on the Dignity of Man\\n\\nAge of Discovery. Italian\\n\\n[e]\\n\\nexplorers and navigators from the maritime republics, eager to find an alternative route to the Indies to bypass the Ottomans, offered their services to monarchs of Atlantic countries and played a key role in ushering colonization of the Americas. The most notable were:\\n\\nChristopher Columbus, who opened the Americas for conquest by Europeans;\\n\\n[72]\\n\\nJohn Cabot, the first European to explore North America since the\\n\\nNorse;\\n\\n[73]\\n\\nAmerigo Vespucci, who demonstrated the New World was not Asia in around 1501,\\n\\nAmerica is named after him.\\n\\n[74]\\n\\n[75]\\n\\nA defensive alliance known as the Italic League was formed between Venice, Naples, Florence, Milan, and the Papacy. Lorenzo the Magnificent de Medici was the Renaissance\\'s greatest patron, his support allowed the League to abort invasion by the Turks. However, the military campaign of Charles VIII of France resulted in the Italian Wars. During the High Renaissance of the 1500s, Italy was the main European battleground as well as its cultural-economic centre. Popes such as Julius II (1503–1513) fought for control of Italy against foreign monarchs; Paul III (1534–1549) preferred to mediate between the European powers to secure peace. In the middle of this conflict, the Medici popes Leo X (1513–1521) and Clement VII (1523–1534) opposed the Reformation and advanced their family interests. In 1559, after the Italian wars, much of north Italy remained in the Holy Roman Empire, while southern Italy was under Spanish Habsburg rule.\\n\\nCispadane Republic, the first\\n\\nItalian tricolour adopted by a sovereign Italian state (1797)\\n\\nCounter-Reformation. Key events include: the\\n\\nCouncil of Trent (1545–1563); adoption of the\\n\\nGregorian calendar; the\\n\\nJesuit China mission; the\\n\\nFrench Wars of Religion; end of the\\n\\nThirty Years\\' War (1618–1648); and the\\n\\nGreat Turkish War. The economy declined in the 1600s and 1700s. Following the European wars of succession of the 18th century, the North fell under the influence of Austria, while the South passed to the Spanish Bourbons. During the\\n\\nNapoleonic Wars, north and central Italy were reorganised as\\n\\nSister Republics of France and, later, as a\\n\\nKingdom of Italy.\\n\\n[76]\\n\\nJoachim Murat, Napoleon\\'s brother-in-law. 1814\\'s\\n\\nCongress of Vienna restored the situation of the late 18th century, but the ideals of the\\n\\nFrench Revolution could not be eradicated, and re-surfaced during the\\n\\npolitical upheavals that characterised the early 19th century. The first adoption of the\\n\\nItalian tricolour by an Italian state, the\\n\\nCispadane Republic, occurred during\\n\\nNapoleonic Italy, following the French Revolution, which advocated national\\n\\nself-determination.\\n\\n[77]\\n\\nTricolour Day.\\n\\n[78]\\n\\nUnification\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nUnification of Italy\\n\\nThe birth of the Kingdom of Italy was the result of efforts of Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the House of Savoy to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire Italian Peninsula. By the mid-19th century, rising Italian nationalism led to revolution.[79] Following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the political and social Italian unification movement, or Risorgimento, emerged to unite Italy by consolidating the states and liberating them from foreign control. A radical figure was the patriotic journalist Giuseppe Mazzini, founder of the political movement Young Italy in the 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement. 1847 saw the first public performance of \"Il Canto degli Italiani\", which became the national anthem in 1946.[80]\\n\\nGiuseppe Mazzini\\n\\nGiuseppe Garibaldi\\n\\n[81]\\n\\n[82]\\n\\nGiuseppe Garibaldi\\n\\n[83]\\n\\nKingdom of Sardinia, whose government was led by\\n\\nCamillo Benso, Count of Cavour, also had ambitions of establishing a united Italian state. In the context of the\\n\\n1848 liberal revolutions that swept Europe, an unsuccessful\\n\\nFirst Italian War of Independence was declared against\\n\\nAustria. In 1855, Sardinia became an ally of Britain and France in the\\n\\nCrimean War.\\n\\n[84]\\n\\nSecond Italian War of Independence of 1859, with the aid of France, resulting in liberating\\n\\nLombardy. On the basis of the\\n\\nPlombières Agreement, the Sardinia ceded\\n\\nSavoy and\\n\\nNice to France, an event that caused the\\n\\nNiçard exodus.\\n\\n[85]\\n\\nIn 1860–61, Garibaldi led the drive for unification in Naples and Sicily.[86] Teano was the site of a famous meeting between Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel II, the last king of Sardinia, during which Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel\\'s hand and hailed him as King of Italy. Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi\\'s Southern Italy in a union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. This allowed the Sardinian government to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861.[87] Victor Emmanuel II became its first king and its capital was moved from Turin to Florence. In 1866, Victor Emmanuel II, allied with Prussia during the Austro-Prussian War, waged the Third Italian War of Independence, which resulted in Italy annexing Venetia. Finally, in 1870, as France abandoned Rome during the Franco-Prussian War, the Italians captured the Papal States, unification was completed, and the capital moved to Rome.[81]\\n\\nLiberal period\\n\\nMain articles: \\n\\nKingdom of Italy,\\n\\nItalian diaspora,\\n\\nItalian Empire, and\\n\\nMilitary history of Italy during World War I\\n\\nVictor Emmanuel II (left) and\\n\\nCamillo Benso, Count of Cavour (right), leading figures in unification, became respectively the first King and Prime Minister of unified Italy.\\n\\nSardinia\\'s constitution was extended to all of Italy in 1861, and provided basic freedoms for the new state; but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied classes. The new kingdom was governed by a parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberals. As northern Italy quickly industrialised, southern and northern rural areas remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions to migrate and fuelling a large and influential diaspora. The Italian Socialist Party increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment. In the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a colonial power by subjugating Eritrea , Somalia, Tripolitania and Cyrenaica in Africa.[88] In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. The pre–World War I period was dominated by Giovanni Giolitti, prime minister five times between 1892-1921.\\n\\nItaly entered into the First World War in 1915 with the aim of completing national unity, so it is also considered the Fourth Italian War of Independence,\\n\\n[89]\\n\\nunification of Italy.\\n\\n[90]\\n\\nGerman and the\\n\\nAustro-Hungarian empires in the\\n\\nTriple Alliance, in 1915 joined the\\n\\nAllies, entering World War I with a\\n\\npromise of substantial territorial gains that included west\\n\\nInner Carniola, the former\\n\\nAustrian Littoral, and\\n\\nDalmatia, as well as parts of the\\n\\nOttoman Empire. The country\\'s contribution to the Allied victory earned it a place as one of the \"\\n\\nBig Four\" powers. Reorganization of the army and conscription led to Italian victories. In October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in victory at the\\n\\nBattle of Vittorio Veneto.\\n\\n[91]\\n\\nending the war less than two weeks later.\\n\\nVictor Emmanuel II Monument in Rome, a\\n\\nnational symbol celebrating the first king of the unified country, and\\n\\nTomb of the Unknown Soldier.\\n\\n[92]\\n\\nTreaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919) and\\n\\nTreaty of Rapallo (1920) allowed for annexation of\\n\\nTrentino Alto-Adige, the\\n\\nJulian March,\\n\\nIstria, the\\n\\nKvarner Gulf and the Dalmatian city of\\n\\nZara. The subsequent\\n\\nTreaty of Rome (1924) led to annexation of\\n\\nFiume by Italy. Italy did not receive other territories promised by the Treaty of London, so this outcome was denounced as a \"\\n\\nmutilated victory\", by\\n\\nBenito Mussolini, which helped lead to the\\n\\nrise of\\n\\nItalian fascism, and became key in the\\n\\npropaganda of Fascist Italy. Historians regard \"mutilated victory\" as a \"political myth\", used by fascists to fuel\\n\\nItalian imperialism.\\n\\n[93]\\n\\nLeague of Nations\\'s executive council.\\n\\nFascist regime and World War II\\n\\nMain articles: \\n\\nFascist Italy,\\n\\nMilitary history of Italy during World War II,\\n\\nItalian Civil War, and\\n\\nItalian campaign (World War II)\\n\\nBenito Mussolini titled himself\\n\\nDuce and ruled the country from 1922 to 1943.\\n\\nThe socialist agitations that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the Russian Revolution, led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy. The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small National Fascist Party, led by Mussolini. In October 1922, the Blackshirts of the National Fascist Party organized a mass demonstration and the \"March on Rome\" coup. King Victor Emmanuel III appointed Mussolini as prime minister, transferring power to the fascists without armed conflict.[94] Mussolini banned political parties and curtailed personal liberties, establishing a dictatorship. These actions attracted international attention and inspired similar dictatorships in Nazi Germany and Francoist Spain.\\n\\nFascism was based upon Italian nationalism and imperialism, seeking to expand Italian possessions via irredentist claims based on the legacy of the Roman and Venetian empires.[95] For this reason the fascists engaged in interventionist foreign policy. In 1935, Mussolini invaded Ethiopia and founded Italian East Africa, resulting in international isolation and leading to Italy\\'s withdrawal from the League of Nations. Italy then allied with Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan, and strongly supported Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, Italy annexed Albania.\\n\\nItaly entered World War II on 10 June 1940. At different times, Italians advanced in British Somaliland, Egypt, the Balkans and eastern fronts. They were, however, defeated on the Eastern Front as well as in the East African and North African campaigns, losing their territories in Africa and the Balkans. Italian war crimes included extrajudicial killings and ethnic cleansing[96] by deportation of about 25,000 people— mainly Yugoslavs— to Italian concentration camps and elsewhere. Yugoslav Partisans perpetrated their own crimes against the ethnic Italian population during and after the war, including the foibe massacres. In Italy and Yugoslavia few war crimes were prosecuted.[97]\\n\\nAn Allied invasion of Sicily began in July 1943, leading to the collapse of the Fascist regime on 25 July. Mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III. On 8 September, Italy signed the Armistice of Cassibile, ending its war with the Allies. The Germans, with the assistance of Italian fascists, succeeded in taking control of north and central Italy. The country remained a battlefield, with the Allies moving up from the south.\\n\\nItalian partisans in Milan during the final insurrection leading to the\\n\\nliberation of Italy in April 1945.\\n\\nIn the north, the Germans set up the Italian Social Republic (RSI), a Nazi puppet state and collaborationist regime with Mussolini installed as leader after he was rescued by German paratroopers. What remained of the Italian troops was organised into the Italian Co-belligerent Army, which fought alongside the Allies, while other Italian forces, loyal to Mussolini, opted to fight alongside the Germans in the National Republican Army. German troops, with RSI collaboration, committed massacres and deported thousands of Jews to death camps. The post-armistice period saw the emergence of the Italian Resistance, who fought a guerrilla war against the Nazi German occupiers and collaborators.[98] This has been described as an Italian civil war due to fighting between partisans and fascist RSI forces.[99][100] In April 1945, with defeat looming, Mussolini attempted to escape north,[101] but was captured and summarily executed near Lake Como by partisans.[102]\\n\\nHostilities ended on 29 April 1945, when the German forces in Italy surrendered. Nearly half a million Italians died in the conflict,[103] society was divided, and the economy all but destroyed—per capita income in 1944 was at its lowest point since 1900.[104] The aftermath left Italy angry with the monarchy for its endorsement of the Fascist regime. These frustrations contributed to a revival of Italian republicanism.[105]\\n\\nRepublican era\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nHistory of the Italian Republic\\n\\nItaly became a republic after the 1946 Italian institutional referendum[106] held on 2 June, a day celebrated since as Festa della Repubblica. This was the first time women voted nationally.[107] Victor Emmanuel III\\'s son, Umberto II, was forced to abdicate. The Republican Constitution was approved in 1948. Under the Treaty of Paris between Italy and the Allied Powers, areas next to the Adriatic Sea were annexed by Yugoslavia, resulting in the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus, which involved the emigration of around 300,000 Istrian and Dalmatian Italians.[108] Italy lost all colonial possessions, ending the Italian Empire; Italy\\'s border today has existed since 1975, when Trieste was formally re-annexed to Italy.\\n\\nAlcide De Gasperi,\\n\\nfirst republican\\n\\nPrime Minister of Italy and one of the\\n\\nFounding fathers of the European Union\\n\\nFears of a Communist takeover proved crucial in 1948, when the Christian Democrats, under Alcide De Gasperi, won a landslide victory.[109] Consequently, in 1949 Italy became a member of NATO. The Marshall Plan revived the economy, which, until the late 1960s, enjoyed a period called the Economic Miracle. In the 1950s, Italy became a founding country of the European Communities, a forerunner of the European Union. From the late 1960s until the early 80s, the country experienced the Years of Lead, characterised by economic difficulties, especially after the 1973 oil crisis; social conflicts; and terrorist massacres.[110]\\n\\nIn the 1980s, two governments were led by non-Christian-Democrat premiers: one republican and one socialist; the Christian Democrats remained, however, the main government party. The economy recovered and Italy became the world\\'s fifth-largest industrial nation after it gained entry into the G7 in the 1970s. However, national debt skyrocketed past 100% of GDP. Between 1992-93, Italy faced terror attacks perpetrated by the Sicilian Mafia as a consequence of new anti-mafia measures by the government.[111] A year later, tourist spots were attacked, leaving 10 dead. The Church condemned the Mafia and an anti-Mafia priest was shot dead in Rome.[112] Voters – disenchanted with political paralysis, massive public debt and extensive corruption uncovered by the Clean Hands investigation – demanded radical reform. The scandals involved all major parties, but especially those in the coalition. The Christian Democrats, who had ruled for almost 50 years, underwent a crisis and disbanded, splitting into factions.[113] The Communists reorganised as a social-democratic force. During the 1990s and 2000s, centre-right (dominated by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi) and centre-left coalitions (led by professor Romano Prodi) alternately governed.\\n\\nIn 2011, amidst the Great Recession, Berlusconi resigned and was replaced by the technocratic cabinet of Mario Monti.[114] In 2014, PD Matteo Renzi became prime minister and the government started constitutional reform. This was rejected in a 2016 referendum and Paolo Gentiloni became prime minister.[115]\\n\\nCOVID-19 emergency\\n\\nDuring the European migrant crisis of the 2010s, Italy was the entry point and leading destination for most asylum seekers entering the EU. Between 2013-18, it took in over 700,000 migrants,[116] mainly from sub-Saharan Africa,[117] which put a strain on the public purse and led to a surge in support for far-right or euro-sceptic parties.[118] The 2018 general election was characterised by a strong showing of the Five Star Movement and Lega. Giuseppe Conte became prime minister of a populist coalition.[119] After only fourteen months the League withdrew its support from Conte, who formed a new coalition of the Five Star Movement and the centre-left.[120]\\n\\nCovid.\\n\\n[121]\\n\\n[122]\\n\\npandemic\\n\\n[123]\\n\\neconomically.\\n\\n[124]\\n\\ngovernment crisis, Conte was forced to resign.\\n\\nMario Draghi, former president of the\\n\\nEuropean Central Bank, formed a\\n\\nnational unity government supported by most main parties,\\n\\n[125]\\n\\n[126]\\n\\nGiorgia Meloni was sworn in as Italy\\'s first female prime minister.

To the north, from west to east, Italy borders France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia, and is roughly delimited by the Alpine watershed, enclosing the Po Valley and the Venetian Plain. It consists of the entirety of the Italian Peninsula, Sicily and Sardinia (the biggest islands of the Mediterranean), and many smaller islands. Some of Italy\\'s territory extends beyond the Alpine basin, and some islands are located outside the Eurasian continental shelf.\\n\\n[128]\\n\\nMediterranean Sea, the\\n\\nLigurian and\\n\\nTyrrhenian seas,\\n\\n[129]\\n\\nIonian Sea,\\n\\n[130]\\n\\nAdriatic Sea.\\n\\n[131]\\n\\nSan Marino and\\n\\nVatican City are\\n\\nenclaves within Italy,\\n\\n[132]\\n\\nCampione d\\'Italia is an Italian\\n\\nexclave in Switzerland.\\n\\n[133]\\n\\n[128]\\n\\nMont Blanc (Monte Bianco) in\\n\\nAosta Valley, the highest point in the European Union\\n\\nApennine landscape in\\n\\nMarche\\n\\nOver 35% of Italian territory is mountainous.[134] The Apennine Mountains form the peninsula\\'s backbone, and the Alps form most of its northern boundary, where Italy\\'s highest point is located on the summit of Mont Blanc (Monte Bianco) at 4,810\\xa0m (15,780\\xa0ft). Other well-known mountains include the Matterhorn (Monte Cervino) in the western Alps, and the Dolomites in the eastern Alps. Many parts of Italy are of volcanic origin. Most small islands and archipelagos in the south are volcanic islands.

Within the southern temperate zone, they determine a Mediterranean climate with local differences.[139] Because of the length of the peninsula and the mostly mountainous hinterland, the climate is highly diverse. In most inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from humid subtropical to humid continental and oceanic. The Po Valley is mostly humid subtropical, with cool winters and hot summers.[140] The coastal areas of Liguria, Tuscany, and most of the South generally fit the Mediterranean climate stereotype, as in the Köppen climate classification.\\n\\nConditions on the coast are different from those in the interior, particularly during winter when the higher altitudes tend to be cold, wet, and often snowy. The coastal regions have mild winters, and hot and generally dry summers; lowland valleys are hot in summer. Winter temperatures vary from 0\\xa0°C (32\\xa0°F) in the Alps to 12\\xa0°C (54\\xa0°F) in Sicily; so, average summer temperatures range from 20\\xa0°C (68\\xa0°F) to over 25\\xa0°C (77\\xa0°F). Winters can vary widely with lingering cold, foggy, and snowy periods in the north, and milder, sunnier conditions in the south. Summers are hot across the country, except at high altitude, particularly in the south. Northern and central areas can experience strong thunderstorms from spring to autumn.[141]\\n\\nBiodiversity\\n\\nMain articles: \\n\\nFauna of Italy and\\n\\nFlora of Italy\\n\\nFurther information: \\n\\nItalian garden\\n\\nItaly\\'s varied geography, including the Alps, Apennines, central Italian woodlands, and southern Italian Garigue and Maquis shrubland, contribute to habitat diversity. As the peninsula is in the centre of the Mediterranean, forming a corridor between central Europe and North Africa, and having 8,000\\xa0km (5,000\\xa0mi) of coastline, Italy has received species from the Balkans, Eurasia, and the Middle East. Italy has probably the highest level of faunal biodiversity in Europe, with over 57,000 species recorded, representing more than a third of all European fauna,[142] and the highest level of biodiversity of animal and plant species within the EU.[143]\\n\\nItalian wolf, the national animal of Italy\\n\\nfauna of Italy includes 4,777\\n\\nendemic animal species,\\n\\n[144]\\n\\nSardinian long-eared bat,\\n\\nSardinian red deer,\\n\\nspectacled salamander,\\n\\nbrown cave salamander,\\n\\nItalian newt,\\n\\nItalian frog,\\n\\nApennine yellow-bellied toad,\\n\\nItalian wall lizard and\\n\\nSicilian pond turtle.

Italy is a signatory to the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats and the Habitats Directive.\\n\\nItaly has many botanical and historic gardens.[154] The Italian garden is stylistically based on symmetry, axial geometry, and the principle of imposing order on nature. It influenced the history of gardening, especially French and English gardens.[155] The Italian garden was influenced by Roman and Italian Renaissance gardens.\\n\\nThe Italian wolf is the national animal of Italy,[156] while the national tree is the strawberry tree.[157] The reasons for this are that the Italian wolf, which inhabits the Apennine Mountains and the Western Alps, features prominently in Latin and Italian cultures, such as the legend of the founding of Rome,[158] while the green leaves, white flowers and red berries of the strawberry tree, native to the Mediterranean, recall the colours of the flag.[157]\\n\\nEnvironment\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nList of national parks of Italy,\\n\\nList of regional parks of Italy, and\\n\\nList of Marine Protected Areas of Italy\\n\\nAfter its quick industrial growth, Italy took time to address its environmental problems. After improvements, Italy now ranks 84th in the world for ecological sustainability.[159] The total area protected by national parks, regional parks, and nature reserves covers about 11% of Italian territory,[160] and 12% of Italy\\'s coastline is protected.[161]\\n\\nItaly has been one of the world\\'s leading producers of renewable energy, in 2010 ranking as the fourth largest provider of installed solar energy capacity[162] and sixth largest of wind power capacity.[163] Renewable energy provided approximately 37% Italy\\'s energy consumption in 2020.[164]\\n\\nThe country operated nuclear reactors between 1963-90 but, after the Chernobyl disaster and referendums, the nuclear programme was terminated, a decision overturned by the government in 2008, with plans to build up to four nuclear power plants. This was in turn struck down by a referendum following the Fukushima nuclear accident.[165]\\n\\nGran Paradiso, established in 1922, is the oldest Italian national park.\\n\\nAir pollution remains severe, especially in the industrialised north. Italy is the twelfth-largest carbon dioxide producer.[166] Extensive traffic and congestion in large cities continue to cause environmental and health issues, even if smog levels have decreased since the 1970s and 1980s, with smog becoming an increasingly rare phenomenon and levels of sulphur dioxide decreasing.[167]\\n\\nMany watercourses and stretches of coast have been contaminated by industrial and agricultural activity, while, because of rising water levels, Venice has experienced regular, intermittent flooding in recent years. Waste is not always disposed legally and has led to permanent adverse health effects on some inhabitants, as in the case of the Seveso disaster.\\n\\nDeforestation, illegal building, and poor land-management policies have led to significant erosion in Italy\\'s mountainous regions, leading to ecological disasters such as the 1963 Vajont Dam flood, and the 1998 Sarno[168] and 2009 Messina mudslides. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 3.65/10, ranking it 142nd globally out of 172 countries.[169]\\n\\nPolitics\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nPolitics of Italy\\n\\nItaly has been a unitary parliamentary republic since 1946, when the monarchy was abolished by a constitutional referendum. The President of Italy, Sergio Mattarella since 2015, is Italy\\'s head of state. The president is elected for a single seven-year term by the Italian Parliament and regional voters in joint session. Italy has a written democratic constitution that resulted from a Constituent Assembly formed by representatives of the anti-fascist forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the liberation of Italy, in World War II.[170]\\n\\nGovernment\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nGovernment of Italy\\n\\nSergio Mattarella\\n\\nPresident of Italy\\n\\nsince 2015\\n\\nGiorgia Meloni\\n\\nPrime Minister of Italy\\n\\nsince 2022\\n\\nItaly has a parliamentary government based on a mixed proportional and majoritarian voting system. The parliament is perfectly bicameral, each house has the same powers. The two houses: the Chamber of Deputies meets in Palazzo Montecitorio, and the Senate of the Republic in Palazzo Madama. A peculiarity of the Italian Parliament is the representation given to Italian citizens permanently living abroad: 8 Deputies and 4 Senators are elected in four distinct overseas constituencies. There are senators for life, appointed by the president \"for outstanding patriotic merits in the social, scientific, artistic or literary field\". Former presidents are ex officio life senators.\\n\\nChamber of Deputies is the lower house of Italy.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister of Italy, is head of government and has executive authority, but must receive a vote of approval from the Council of Ministers to execute most policies. The prime minister and cabinet are appointed by the President, and confirmed by a vote of confidence in parliament. To remain as prime minister, one has to pass votes of confidence. The role of prime minister is similar to most other parliamentary systems; but they are not authorised to dissolve parliament. Another difference is that the political responsibility for intelligence is with the prime minister, who has exclusive power to coordinate intelligence policies, determine financial resources, strengthen cybersecurity, apply and protect State secrets and authorise agents to carry out operations, in Italy or abroad.[171]\\n\\nThe major political parties are the Brothers of Italy, Democratic Party, and Five Star Movement. During the 2022 general election, these three and their coalitions won 357 of the 400 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, and 187 of 200 in the Senate. The centre-right coalition which included: Giorgia Meloni\\'s Brothers of Italy, Matteo Salvini\\'s League, Silvio Berlusconi\\'s Forza Italia, and Maurizio Lupi\\'s Us Moderates, won most seats in parliament. The rest were taken by the centre-left coalition which included: the Democratic Party, the Greens and Left Alliance, Aosta Valley, More Europe, Civic Commitment, the Five Star Movement, Action – Italia Viva, South Tyrolean People\\'s Party, South calls North, and the Associative Movement of Italians Abroad.\\n\\nLaw and criminal justice\\n\\nMain articles: \\n\\nLaw of Italy,\\n\\nJudiciary of Italy, and\\n\\nLaw enforcement in Italy\\n\\nSupreme Court of Cassation, Rome\\n\\nThe law of Italy has several sources. These are hierarchical: the law or regulation from a lower source cannot conflict with the rule of an upper source (hierarchy of sources).[172] The Constitution of 1948 is the highest source.[173] The Constitutional Court of Italy rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution. The judiciary bases their decisions on Roman law modified by the Napoleonic Code and later statutes. The Supreme Court of Cassation is the highest court for both criminal and civil appeals.\\n\\nItaly lags behind other Western European nations in LGBT rights.[174] Italy\\'s law prohibiting torture is considered behind international standards.[175]\\n\\nLaw enforcement is complex with multiple police forces.[176] The national policing agencies are the Polizia di Stato (State Police), the Carabinieri, the Guardia di Finanza (Financial Police), and the Polizia Penitenziaria (Prison Police),[177] as well as the Guardia Costiera (Coast Guard Police).[176] Although policing is primarily provided on a national basis,[177] there are also the provincial and municipal police.[176]\\n\\nSince their appearance in the middle of the 19th century, Italian organised crime and criminal organisations have infiltrated the social and economic life of many regions in Southern Italy; the most notorious is the Sicilian Mafia, which expanded into foreign countries including the US. Mafia receipts may reach 9%[178] of GDP.[179] A 2009 report identified 610 comuni which have a strong Mafia presence, where 13 million Italians live and 15% of GDP is produced.[180] The Calabrian \\'Ndrangheta, probably the most powerful crime syndicate of Italy, accounts alone for 3% of GDP.[181]\\n\\nHowever, at 0.013 per 1,000 people, Italy has only the 47th highest murder rate,[182] compared to 61 countries, and the 43rd highest number of rapes per 1,000 people, compared to 64 countries in the world. These are relatively low figures among developed countries.\\n\\nForeign relations\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nForeign relations of Italy\\n\\nG7 leaders at the\\n\\n43rd G7 summit in\\n\\nTaormina\\n\\nItaly is a founding member of the European Economic Community (EEC), now the European Union (EU), and of NATO. Italy was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and is a member and strong supporter of international organisations, such as the OECD, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization (GATT/WTO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe, and the Central European Initiative. Its turns in the rotating presidencies of international organisations include the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2018, G7 in 2017, and the EU Council in 2014. Italy is a recurrent non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.\\n\\nItaly strongly supports multilateral international politics, endorsing the UN and its international security activities. In 2013, Italy had 5,296 troops deployed abroad, engaged in 33 UN and NATO missions in 25 countries.[183] Italy deployed troops in support of UN peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Mozambique, and East Timor. Italy provides support for NATO and UN operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Albania, and deployed over 2,000 troops to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) from 2003.\\n\\nItaly supported international efforts to reconstruct and stabilise Iraq, but it had withdrawn its military contingent of 3,200 troops by 2006. In August 2006, Italy deployed about 2,450 troops for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.[184] Italy is one of the largest financiers of the Palestinian Authority, contributing €60 million in 2013 alone.[185]\\n\\nMilitary\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nItalian Armed Forces\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nList of wars involving Italy\\n\\nMM Cavour, the\\n\\nflagship of the\\n\\nItalian Navy\\n\\nB1 Centauro during a patrol in\\n\\nBosnia-Herzegovina as part of\\n\\nIFOR\\n\\nThe Italian Army, Navy, Air Force, and Carabinieri collectively form the Italian Armed Forces, under the command of the High Council of Defence, presided over by the President, per the Constitution of Italy. According to article 78, the Parliament has the authority to declare a state of war and vest the necessary war-making powers in the government.\\n\\nDespite not being a branch of the armed forces, the Guardia di Finanza has military status and is organized along military lines.[g] Since 2005, military service has been voluntary.[186] In 2010, the Italian military had 293,202 personnel on active duty,[187] of which 114,778 are Carabinieri.[188] As part of NATO\\'s nuclear sharing strategy, Italy hosts 90 US B61 nuclear bombs located at the Ghedi and Aviano air bases.[189]\\n\\nThe Army is the national ground defence force. It was formed in 1946, when Italy became a republic, from what remained of the \"Royal Italian Army\". Its best-known combat vehicles are the Dardo infantry fighting vehicle, the B1 Centauro tank destroyer, and the Ariete tank, and among its aircraft are the Mangusta attack helicopter, deployed on EU, NATO, and UN missions. It has at its disposal Leopard 1 and M113 armoured vehicles.\\n\\nThe Italian Navy is a blue-water navy. It was also formed in 1946 from what remained of the Regia Marina (the \"Royal Navy\"). The Navy, being a member of the EU and NATO, has taken part in coalition peacekeeping operations around the world. In 2014, the Navy operated 154 vessels in service, including minor auxiliary vessels.[190]\\n\\nThe Italian Air Force was founded as an independent service arm in 1923 by King Victor Emmanuel III as the Regia Aeronautica (\"Royal Air Force\"). After World War II, it was renamed as the Regia Aeronautica. In 2021, the Italian Air Force operated 219 combat jets. A transport capability is guaranteed by a fleet of 27 C-130Js and C-27J Spartan. The acrobatic display team is the Frecce Tricolori (\"Tricolour Arrows\").\\n\\nAn autonomous corps of the military, the Carabinieri are the gendarmerie and military police of Italy, policing the military and civilian population alongside Italy\\'s other police forces. While different branches of the Carabinieri report to separate ministries, the corps reports to the Ministry of Internal Affairs when maintaining public order and security.[191]\\n\\nAdministrative divisions\\n\\nMain articles: \\n\\nRegions of Italy,\\n\\nProvinces of Italy,\\n\\nMetropolitan cities of Italy, and\\n\\nComune\\n\\nApulia\\n\\nBasilicata\\n\\nCalabria\\n\\nSicily\\n\\nMolise\\n\\nCampania\\n\\nAbruzzo\\n\\nLazio\\n\\nUmbria\\n\\nMarche\\n\\nTuscany\\n\\nSardinia\\n\\nEmilia-Romagna\\n\\nLiguria\\n\\nPiedmont\\n\\nFriuli-\\n\\nVenezia Giulia\\n\\nAosta\\n\\nValley\\n\\nTrentino-\\n\\nAlto Adige\\n\\nVeneto\\n\\nLombardy\\n\\nAdriatic Sea\\n\\nIonian Sea\\n\\nMediterranean Sea\\n\\nTyrrhenian Sea\\n\\nLigurian Sea\\n\\nItaly is constituted of 20 regions (regioni)—five of which have special autonomous status which enables them to enact legislation on additional matters.[192]\\n\\nAbruzzo\\n\\nAosta Valley\\n\\nApulia\\n\\nBasilicata\\n\\nCalabria\\n\\nCampania\\n\\nEmilia-Romagna\\n\\nFriuli-Venezia Giulia\\n\\nLazio\\n\\nLiguria\\n\\nLombardy\\n\\nMarche\\n\\nMolise\\n\\nPiedmont\\n\\nSardinia\\n\\nSicily\\n\\nTrentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol\\n\\nTuscany\\n\\nUmbria\\n\\nVeneto\\n\\nThe regioni contain 107 provinces (province) or metropolitan cities (città metropolitane), and 7,904 municipalities (comuni).[192]\\n\\nDemographics\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nDemographics of Italy\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nItalians,\\n\\nItalian diaspora,\\n\\nGenetic history of Italy,\\n\\nList of cities in Italy, and\\n\\nRacism in Italy\\n\\nIn 2020, Italy had 60,317,116 inhabitants.[193] The population density, of 202 inhabitants per square kilometre (520/sq\\xa0mi), is higher than most West European countries. However, distribution is uneven: the most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (almost half the population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennine highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata, and the island of Sardinia, as well as much of Sicily, are sparsely populated.\\n\\nItaly\\'s population almost doubled during the 20th century, but the pattern of growth was uneven because of large-scale internal migration from the rural South to the industrial North, a consequence of the Italian economic miracle of the 1950–1960s. High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to decline; the total fertility rate (TFR) reached an all-time low of 1.2 children per woman in 1995, well below the replacement rate of 2.1 and considerably below the high of 5 in 1883.[194] Since 2008, when the rate climbed slightly to 1.4,[195][196] the number of births has consistently declined every year, reaching a record low of 379,000 in 2023—the fewest since 1861.[197] Although the TFR was expected to reach 1.6–1.8 in 2030,[198] as of 2024, it stood at 1.2.[199]\\n\\nAs a result of these trends, Italy\\'s population is rapidly aging and gradually shrinking. Nearly one in four Italians is over 65.[197] and the country has the fourth oldest population in the world, with a median age of 48 and an average age of 46.6.[200][201] The overall population has been falling steadily since 2014 and is estimated to have fallen just below 59 million in 2024, representing a cumulative loss of more than 1.36 million people over the span of a decade. According to ISTAT, Italy could lose almost one-tenth of its residents in the next 25 years, with the population set to decline to 54.4 million by 2050. The demographic situation has been described as a national crisis.[202][203]\\n\\nFrom the late 19th century to the 1960s, Italy was a country of mass emigration. Between 1898-1914, the peak years of Italian diaspora, approximately 750,000 Italians emigrated annually.[204] The diaspora included more than 25 million Italians and is considered the greatest mass migration of recent times.[205] As a result, today more than 4 million Italian citizens live abroad,[206] while at least 60 million people of full or part Italian ancestry live outside of Italy, most notably in Argentina,[207] Brazil,[208] Uruguay,[209] Venezuela,[210] the US,[211] Canada,[212] Australia,[213] and France.[214]\\n\\nLargest cities\\n\\nv t e Largest cities or towns in Italy ISTAT estimates for 31 December 2022 Rank Name Region Municipal pop.

Another source of immigration is neighbouring North Africa, with arrivals soaring as a consequence of the Arab Spring. Growing migration fluxes from Asia-Pacific (notably China[216] and the Philippines) and Latin America have been recorded.\\n\\nAs of 2010, the foreign-born population was from the following regions: Europe (54%), Africa (22%), Asia (16%), the Americas (8%), and Oceania (0.06%). The distribution of the foreign population is geographically varied: in 2020, 61% of foreign citizens lived in the north, 24% in the centre, 11% in the south, and 4% on the islands.[217]\\n\\nIn 2021, Italy had about 5.2 million foreign residents,[1][218] making up 9% of the population. The figures include more than half a million children born in Italy to foreign nationals but exclude foreign nationals who have subsequently acquired Italian citizenship;[219] in 2016, about 201,000 people became Italian citizens.[220] The official figures also exclude illegal immigrants, which was estimated to be 670,000 as of 2008.[221] About one million Romanian citizens are registered as living in Italy, representing the largest migrant population.\\n\\nLanguages\\n\\nMain articles: \\n\\nLanguages of Italy,\\n\\nItalian language,\\n\\nRegional Italian, and\\n\\nGeographical distribution of Italian speakers\\n\\nlanguages spoken in Italy\\n\\nItaly\\'s official language is Italian.[222][223] There are an estimated 64 million native Italian speakers around the world,[224] and another 21 million use it as a second language.[225] Italian is often natively spoken as a regional dialect, not to be confused with Italy\\'s regional and minority languages;[226] however, during the 20th century, the establishment of a national education system led to a decrease in regional dialects. Standardisation was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, due to economic growth and the rise of mass media and television.\\n\\nTwelve \"historical minority languages\" are formally recognised: Albanian, Catalan, German, Greek, Slovene, Croatian, French, Franco-Provençal, Friulian, Ladin, Occitan, and Sardinian.[222] Four of these enjoy co-official status in their respective regions: French in the Aosta Valley;[227] German in South Tyrol, and Ladin as well in some parts of the same province and in parts of the neighbouring Trentino;[228] and Slovene in the provinces of Trieste, Gorizia and Udine.[229] Other Ethnologue, ISO, and UNESCO languages are not recognised under Italian law. Like France, Italy has signed the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, but has not ratified it.[230]\\n\\nDue to recent immigration, Italy has sizeable populations whose native language is not Italian, nor a regional language. According to the Italian National Institute of Statistics, Romanian is the most common mother tongue among foreign residents: almost 800,000 people speak Romanian as their first language (22% of foreign residents aged 6 and over). Other prevalent mother tongues are Arabic (spoken by over 475,000; 13% of foreign residents), Albanian (380,000), and Spanish (255,000).[231]\\n\\nReligion\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nReligion in Italy\\n\\nReligion in 2023[232]\\n\\nCatholicism (61%)\\n\\nProtestantism (4%)\\n\\nOther Christianity (3%)\\n\\nNo religion (28%)\\n\\nPrefer not to say (2%)\\n\\nIslam (1%)\\n\\nOther (1%)\\n\\nThe Holy See, the episcopal jurisdiction of Rome, contains the government of the Catholic Church. It is recognised as a sovereign entity, headed by the Pope, who is also the Bishop of Rome, with which diplomatic relations can be maintained.[233][h] Often incorrectly referred to as \"the Vatican\", the Holy See is not the same, it is the jurisdiction of the Pope, whilst the Vatican is a city-state.[234]\\n\\nAlthough historically dominated by Catholicism, religiosity in Italy is declining.[235] Most Catholics are nominal; the Associated Press describes Italian Catholicism as \"a faith that\\'s... nominally embraced but rarely lived.\"[235] Italy has the world\\'s fifth-largest Catholic population and the largest in Europe.[236] Since 1985, Catholicism is no longer the official religion.[237]\\n\\nIn 2011, minority Christian faiths included an estimated 1.5 million Orthodox Christians, Protestantism has been growing.[238]Italy has for centuries welcomed Jews expelled from other countries, notably Spain. However, about 20% of Italian Jews were killed during The Holocaust.[239] This, together with emigration before and after World War II, has left around 28,000 Jews.[240] There are 120,000 Hindus[241] and 70,000 Sikhs.[242]\\n\\nThe state devolves shares of income tax to recognised religious communities, under a regime known as eight per thousand. Donations are allowed to Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, and Hindu communities; however, Islam remains excluded, as no Muslim communities have signed a concordat.[243] Taxpayers who do not wish to fund a religion contribute their share to the welfare system.[244]\\n\\nEducation\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nEducation in Italy\\n\\nBologna University, established in 1088 AD, is the\\n\\nworld\\'s oldest university in continuous operation.\\n\\nEducation is mandatory and free from ages six to sixteen,[245] and consists of five stages: kindergarten, primary school, lower secondary school, upper secondary school, and university.[246]\\n\\nPrimary school lasts eight years. Students are given a basic education in Italian, English, mathematics, natural sciences, history, geography, social studies, physical education, and visual and musical arts. Secondary school lasts for five years and includes three traditional types of schools focused on different academic levels: the liceo prepares students for university studies with a classical or scientific curriculum, while the istituto tecnico and the istituto professionale prepare pupils for vocations.\\n\\nIn 2018, secondary education was evaluated as being below the average among OECD countries.[247] Italy scored below the OECD average in reading and science, and near the OECD average in maths.[247] Compared to school children in other OECD countries, children missed out on a greater amount of learning due to absences and indiscipline in classrooms.[248] A wide gap exists between northern schools, which perform near average, and the south, which had much poorer results.[249]\\n\\npublic universities, private universities, and the prestigious and selective\\n\\nsuperior graduate schools, such as the\\n\\nScuola Normale Superiore di Pisa\\n\\n[250]\\n\\nBologna University, founded in 1088, is the\\n\\noldest university still in operation,\\n\\n[251]\\n\\n[252]\\n\\nBocconi University, the\\n\\nUniversità Cattolica del Sacro Cuore\\n\\nLUISS, the\\n\\nPolytechnic University of Turin, the\\n\\nPolytechnic University of Milan, the\\n\\nSapienza University of Rome, and the\\n\\nUniversity of Milan are also ranked among the best.\\n\\n[253]\\n\\nHealth\\n\\nMain articles: \\n\\nHealth in Italy and\\n\\nHealthcare in Italy\\n\\nOlive oil and vegetables are central to the Mediterranean diet.\\n\\n[254]\\n\\nLife expectancy is 80 for men and 85 for women, placing the country 5th in the world.[255] Compared to other Western countries, Italy has a low rate of adult obesity (below 10%[256]), as there are health benefits of the Mediterranean diet.[257] In 2013, UNESCO, prompted by Italy, added the Mediterranean diet to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of Italy, Morocco, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus, and Croatia.[258] The proportion of daily smokers was 22% in 2012, down from 24% in 2000 but above the OECD average.[259] Since 2005, smoking in public places has been restricted to \"specially ventilated rooms\".[260]\\n\\nSince 1978, the state has run a universal public healthcare system.[261] However, healthcare is provided to all citizens and residents by a mixed public-private system. The public part is the Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, which is organised under the Ministry of Health and administered on a devolved regional basis. Healthcare spending accounted for 10% of GDP in 2020.[262] Italy\\'s healthcare system has been consistently ranked among the best in the world.[263] However, in 2018 Italy\\'s healthcare was ranked 20th in Europe by the Euro health consumer index.\\n\\nEconomy\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nEconomy of Italy\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nList of largest Italian companies\\n\\n[264]\\n\\ncapitalist\\n\\nmixed economy that is the third-largest in the\\n\\neurozone and\\n\\n13th-largest in the world by purchasing power parity GDP.\\n\\n[265]\\n\\nninth-largest national wealth and the\\n\\nthird-largest central bank\\n\\ngold reserve.

This has produced a niche-markets manufacturing sector often focused on the export of luxury products. While less capable of competing on quantity, it can compete with Asian economies that have lower labor costs, through higher-quality products.[273] Italy was the world\\'s 10th-largest exporter in 2019.

Italy is one of the world\\'s leading producers of pumice, pozzolana, and feldspar.[282] Another notable resource is marble, especially the famous white Carrara marble from Tuscany.\\n\\nItaly is part of a monetary union, the eurozone, which represents around 330 million citizens, and of the European single market, which represents more than 500 million consumers. Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among EU members and EU legislation. Italy joined the common European currency, the euro, in 2002.[283] Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank.\\n\\nItaly was hit hard by the 2007–2008 financial crisis, which exacerbated structural problems.[284] After strong GDP growth of 5–6% per year from the 1950s to the early 1970s,[285] and a progressive slowdown in the 1980–90s, the country stagnated in the 2000s.[286] Political efforts to revive growth with massive government spending produced a severe rise in public debt, that stood at over 132% of GDP in 2017,[287] the second highest in the EU, after Greece.[288] The largest portion of Italian public debt is owned by national subjects, a major difference between Italy and Greece,[289] and the level of household debt is much lower than the OECD average.[290]\\n\\nA gaping North–South divide is a major factor of socio-economic weakness,[291] there is a huge difference in official income between northern and southern regions and municipalities.[292] The richest province, Alto Adige-South Tyrol, earns 152% of the national GDP per capita, while the poorest region, Calabria earns 61%.[293] The unemployment rate (11%) is above the eurozone average,[294] but the disaggregated figure is 7% in the North and 19% in the South.[295] The youth unemployment rate (32% in 2018) is extremely high.\\n\\nAgriculture\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nAgriculture in Italy\\n\\nVal d\\'Orcia, Tuscany.

In 2005, about 34,667,000 cars (590 per 1,000 people) and 4,015,000 goods vehicles circulated on the network.[300]\\n\\nETR 500 train on the\\n\\nFlorence–Rome high-speed line, the first high-speed railway in Europe.\\n\\n[301]\\n\\nThe railway network, state-owned and operated by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (FSI), in 2008 totalled 16,529\\xa0km (10,271\\xa0mi) of which 11,727\\xa0km (7,287\\xa0mi) is electrified, and on which 4,802 locomotives and railcars run. The main public operator of high-speed trains is Trenitalia, part of FSI. High-speed trains are in three categories: Frecciarossa (red arrow) trains operate at a maximum 300\\xa0km/h on dedicated high-speed tracks; Frecciargento (silver arrow) operate at a maximum 250\\xa0km/h on high-speed and mainline tracks; and Frecciabianca (white arrow) operate on high-speed regional lines at a maximum 200\\xa0km/h. Italy has 11 rail border crossings over the Alpine mountains with neighbouring countries.\\n\\nItaly is fifth in Europe by number of passengers using air transport, with about 148 million passengers, or about 10% of the European total in 2011.[302] In 2022, there were 45 civil airports, including the hubs of Milan Malpensa Airport and Rome Fiumicino Airport.[303] Since 2021, Italy\\'s flag carrier has been ITA Airways, which took over from Alitalia.[304]\\n\\nIn 2004, there were 43 major seaports, including Genoa, the country\\'s largest and second-largest in the Mediterranean. In 2005 Italy maintained a civilian air fleet of about 389,000 units and a merchant fleet of 581 ships.[300] The national inland waterways network had a length of 2,400\\xa0km (1,491\\xa0mi) for commercial traffic in 2012.[200]\\n\\nItaly has been the final destination of the Silk Road for many centuries. In particular, the construction of the Suez Canal intensified sea trade with East Africa and Asia from the 19th century. Since the end of the Cold War and with increasing European integration, trade relations have intensified again. North Italian ports such as the deep-water port of Trieste, with its extensive rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe, are again the destination of subsidies and significant foreign investment.[305]\\n\\nEnergy\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nEnergy in Italy\\n\\nFurther information: \\n\\nRenewable energy in Italy and\\n\\nElectricity sector in Italy\\n\\nPiombino.

Wind power, hydroelectricity, and geothermal power are significant sources of electricity in the country. Renewable sources account for 28% of all electricity produced, with hydro alone reaching 13%, followed by solar at 6%, wind at 4%, bioenergy at 3.5%, and geothermal at 1.6%.[307] The rest of the national demand is supplied by fossil fuels (natural gas 38%, coal 13%, oil 8%) and imports.[307] Eni, operating in 79 countries, is one of the seven \"Big Oil\" companies, and one of the world\\'s largest industrial companies.[308]\\n\\nSolar energy production alone accounted for 9% of electricity in 2014, making Italy the country with the highest contribution from solar energy in the world.[306] The Montalto di Castro Photovoltaic Power Station, completed in 2010, is the largest photovoltaic (PV) power station in Italy with 85 MW.[309] Italy was the first country to exploit geothermal energy to produce electricity.[310] Italy managed four nuclear reactors until the 1980s. However, nuclear power in Italy was abandoned after 1987 referendums (in the wake of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster), though Italy still imports nuclear energy from Italy-owned reactors in foreign territories.\\n\\nScience and technology\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nScience and technology in Italy\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nList of Italian inventions and discoveries\\n\\nGalileo Galilei, father of modern science, physics and astronomy\\n\\n[311]\\n\\n[312]\\n\\n[313]\\n\\n[314]\\n\\n[315]\\n\\nEnrico Fermi, creator of the world\\'s\\n\\nfirst nuclear reactor\\n\\n[316]\\n\\nThrough the centuries, Italy has fostered a scientific community that produced major discoveries the sciences.

During the Middle Ages, courts competed to attract artists, and scholars, thus producing a legacy of monuments, paintings, music and literature. Italy has made a substantial contribution to the cultural and historical heritage of Europe.[344]\\n\\nArchitecture\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nItalian architecture\\n\\nItaly is known for its architectural achievements,[345] such as the construction of arches, domes, and similar structures by ancient Rome, the founding of the Renaissance architectural movement in the late 14th to 16th centuries, and as the home of Palladianism, a style that inspired movements such as Neoclassical architecture and influenced designs of country houses all over the world, notably in the UK and US during the late 17th to early 20th centuries.\\n\\nLeaning Tower of Pisa\\n\\nThe first to begin a recognised sequence of designs were the Greeks and the Etruscans, progressing to classical Roman,[346] then the revival of the classical Roman era during the Renaissance, and evolving into the Baroque era. The Christian concept of the basilica, a style that came to dominate in the Middle Ages, was invented in Rome.[347] Romanesque architecture, which flourished from approximately 800 to 1100 AD, was one of the most fruitful and creative periods in Italian architecture, when masterpieces, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Basilica of Sant\\'Ambrogio in Milan were built. It was known for its usage of Roman arches, stained glass windows, and curved columns. The main innovation of Italian Romanesque architecture was the vault, which had never been seen in Western architecture.[348]\\n\\nItalian architecture significantly evolved during the Renaissance. Filippo Brunelleschi contributed to architectural design with his dome for the Cathedral of Florence, a feat of engineering not seen since antiquity.[349] A popular achievement of Italian Renaissance architecture was St. Peter\\'s Basilica, designed by Donato Bramante in the early 16th century. Andrea Palladio influenced architects throughout Western Europe with the villas and palaces he designed in the 16th century.[350]\\n\\nThe Baroque period produced outstanding Italian architects in the 17th century. The most original work of late Baroque and Rococo architecture is the Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi, dating to the 18th century.[351] Luigi Vanvitelli, in 1752, began the construction of the Royal Palace of Caserta.[352] In the late 18th and early 19th centuries Italy was influenced by the Neoclassical architectural movement. Villas, palaces, gardens, interiors, and art began again to be based on ancient Roman and Greek themes.[353]\\n\\nDuring the Fascist period, the supposedly \"Novecento movement\" flourished, based on the rediscovery of imperial Rome. Marcello Piacentini, responsible for the urban transformations of cities devised a form of simplified Neoclassicism.[354]\\n\\nVisual art\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nItalian art\\n\\nThe Last Supper\\n\\nSanta Maria delle Grazie, Milan\\n\\nThe history of Italian visual arts is significant to Western painting. Roman art was influenced by Greece and can be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. The only surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings.[355] These may contain the first examples of trompe-l\\'œil, pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.[356]\\n\\nThe Italian Renaissance is considered to be the golden age of painting, spanning from the 14th through the mid-17th centuries and having significant influence outside Italy. Artists such as Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, Tintoretto, Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Titian took painting to a higher level through the use of perspective. The study of human anatomy and proportion led to refinement of drawing and painting techniques. Michelangelo was active as a sculptor and his works include his David, Pietà, and Moses.\\n\\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, the High Renaissance gave rise to a stylised art known as Mannerism. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of Piero della Francesca and the calm Virgins of Raphael, were replaced by the troubled expressions of Pontormo and emotional intensity of El Greco.\\n\\nThe Birth of Venus\\n\\nSandro Botticelli,\\n\\nUffizi Gallery, Florence\\n\\nIn the 17th century, among the greatest painters of Italian Baroque are Caravaggio, Artemisia Gentileschi, Carlo Saraceni, and Bartolomeo Manfredi. In the 18th century, Italian Rococo was mainly inspired by French Rococo. Italian Neoclassical sculpture focused, with Antonio Canova\\'s nudes, on the idealist aspect of the movement.\\n\\nIn the 19th century, Romantic painters included Francesco Hayez, and Francesco Podesti. Impressionism was brought from France to Italy by the Macchiaioli; Realism by Gioacchino Toma and Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo. In the 20th century, with Futurism, Italy rose again as a seminal country for evolution in painting and sculpture. Futurism was succeeded by the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico, who exerted an influence on the Surrealists.[357]\\n\\nLiterature\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nItalian literature\\n\\nFormal Latin literature began in 240 BC, when the first stage play was performed in Rome.[358] Latin literature was, and is, highly influential, with numerous writers, poets, philosophers, and historians, such as Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger, Virgil, Horace, Propertius, Ovid, and Livy. The Romans were famous for their oral tradition, poetry, drama, and epigrams.[359] In the early 13th century, Francis of Assisi was the first Italian poet, with his religious song Canticle of the Sun.[360]\\n\\nDante Alighieri, one of the greatest poets. His epic poem\\n\\nThe Divine Comedy ranks among the finest works of\\n\\nworld literature.\\n\\n[361]\\n\\nAt the court of Emperor Frederick II in Sicily, in the 13th century, lyrics modelled on Provençal forms and themes were written in a refined version of the local vernacular. One of these poets was Giacomo da Lentini, inventor of the sonnet form; the most famous early sonneteer was Petrarch.[362]\\n\\nGuido Guinizelli is the founder of the Dolce Stil Novo, a school that added a philosophical dimension to love poetry. This new understanding of love, expressed in a smooth style, influenced the Florentine poet Dante Alighieri, who established the basis of modern Italian. Dante\\'s work, the Divine Comedy, is among the finest in literature.[361] Petrarch and Giovanni Boccaccio, sought and imitated the works of antiquity and cultivated their own artistic personalities. Petrarch achieved fame through his collection of poems, Il Canzoniere. Equally influential was Boccaccio\\'s The Decameron, a very popular collection of short stories.[363]\\n\\nRenaissance authors\\' works include: Niccolò Machiavelli\\'s The Prince, an essay on political science in which the \"effectual truth\" is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal. Giovanni Francesco Straparola and Giambattista Basile, who wrote The Facetious Nights of Straparola (1550–55) and the Pentamerone (1634), respectively, printed some of the first known versions of fairy tales in Europe.[364] In the early 17th century, masterpieces were created, such as Giambattista Marino\\'s mythological poem, L\\'Adone. The Baroque period produced the clear scientific prose of Galileo. In the 17th century, the Arcadians began a movement to restore simplicity and classical restraint to poetry.[365]\\n\\nItalian writers embraced Romanticism in the 19th century, it coincided with ideas of the Risorgimento, the movement that brought Italian unification. Unification was heralded by the poets Vittorio Alfieri, Ugo Foscolo, and Giacomo Leopardi. Works by Alessandro Manzoni, the leading Italian Romantic, are a symbol of Italian unification for their patriotic message and because of his efforts in the development of modern, unified Italian.[366]\\n\\nMachiavelli, the founder of modern\\n\\npolitical science\\n\\nIn the late 19th century, a literary movement called Verismo, which extolled realism, played a major role in Italian literature. Emilio Salgari, a writer of action-adventure swashbucklers and a pioneer of science fiction, published his Sandokan series.[367] In 1883, Carlo Collodi published The Adventures of Pinocchio, which became the most celebrated children\\'s classic by an Italian author and one of the world\\'s most translated non-religious books.[368] A movement called Futurism influenced literature in the early 20th century. Filippo Tommaso Marinetti wrote Manifesto of Futurism and called for the use of language and metaphors that glorified the speed, dynamism, and violence of the machine age.[369]\\n\\nModern literary figures and Nobel laureates are Gabriele D\\'Annunzio (active 1889 to 1910), nationalist poet Giosuè Carducci 1906 Nobel laureate, realist writer Grazia Deledda 1926 laureate, modern theatre author Luigi Pirandello in 1936, short story writer Italo Calvino in 1960, poets Salvatore Quasimodo in 1959 and Eugenio Montale in 1975, Umberto Eco in 1980, and satirist and theatre author Dario Fo in 1997.[370]\\n\\nPhilosophy\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nItalian philosophy\\n\\nWestern philosophy, beginning with the Greeks and Romans, and Renaissance humanism, the\\n\\nAge of Enlightenment, and\\n\\nmodern philosophy.\\n\\n[371]\\n\\nPythagoras, founder of the Italian school of philosophy in\\n\\nCrotone.\\n\\n[372]\\n\\nXenophanes,\\n\\nParmenides and\\n\\nZeno.

Italian philosophers were influential in development of the non-Marxist liberal socialism philosophy. In the 1960s, left-wing activists adopted the anti-authoritarian pro-working class theories that became known as autonomism and workerism.[383]\\n\\nItalian feminists include Sibilla Aleramo, Alaide Gualberta Beccari, and Anna Maria Mozzoni, and proto-feminist philosophies had previously been touched upon by Italian writers. Italian educator Maria Montessori created the philosophy of education that bears her name.[376] Giuseppe Peano was a founder of analytic philosophy and the contemporary philosophy of mathematics. Analytic philosophers include Carlo Penco, Gloria Origgi, Pieranna Garavaso, and Luciano Floridi.[371]\\n\\nTheatre\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nTheatre of Italy\\n\\nCommedia dell\\'arte\\n\\nI Gelosi in a late 16th-century Flemish painting\\n\\nItalian theatre came about in the Middle Ages, with its antecedents dating back to ancient Greek colonies in southern Italy,[384] as well as the theatre of the Italic peoples[385] and the theatre of ancient Rome. There were two main lines along which theatre developed. The first, dramatization of Catholic liturgies, and the second, formed by pagan forms of spectacle such as staging for city festivals, court preparations of jesters, and songs of the troubadours.[386] Renaissance theatre marked the beginning of modern theatre due to the rediscovery of the classics. Ancient theatrical texts, were translated and staged at courts, and moved to public theatres. Theatre came close to that of today: a performance in a designated place in which the public participates. In the late 15th century, the cities of Ferrara and Rome were important for the rediscovery and renewal of theatre.[387]\\n\\nDuring the 16th, into the 18th century, commedia dell\\'arte was a form of improvisational theatre, and is still performed. Travelling troupes of players set up an outdoor stage and provided amusement in the form of juggling, acrobatics, and humorous plays. Plays did not originate from written drama but scenarios called lazzi, loose frameworks around which actors would improvise. The characters of the commedia usually represent fixed social types and stock characters, each of which has a distinct costume.[388] The first recorded commedia dell\\'arte performances came from Rome as early as 1551.[389] Female roles were played by women, documented as early as the 1560s, making them the first known professional actresses in Europe since antiquity. Lucrezia Di Siena, namd on a 1564 contract, has been referred to as the first Italian actress known by name, with Vincenza Armani and Barbara Flaminia as the first prima donnas.[390]\\n\\nBallet originated in Italy. It began during the Renaissance as an outgrowth of court pageantry,[391] where aristocratic weddings were lavish celebrations; musicians and dancers provided elaborate entertainment.[392] At first, ballets were woven into the midst of an opera to allow the audience relief from dramatic intensity. By the mid-seventeenth century, ballets in their entirety were performed between acts of an opera. Ballets became part of theatrical life.[393]\\n\\nMusic\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nMusic of Italy\\n\\nFrom folk to classical, music is an intrinsic part of Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy,[394] and many prevailing forms, such as the symphony, concerto, and sonata, trace their roots back to innovations in 16th- and 17th-century Italian music.\\n\\nItaly\\'s most famous composers include the Renaissance Palestrina, Monteverdi, and Gesualdo; the Baroque Scarlatti, and Vivaldi; the classical Paganini, and Rossini; and the Romantic Verdi and Puccini. While classical music has a strong hold in Italy, as evidenced by the fame of its opera houses, and performers such as the pianist Maurizio Pollini and tenor Luciano Pavarotti, Italians have been no less appreciative of their thriving contemporary scene.\\n\\nLuciano Pavarotti, one of the finest tenors of the 20th century and \"King of the\\n\\nHigh Cs\"\\n\\n[395]\\n\\nItaly is known as the birthplace of opera.[396] Italian opera is believed to have been founded in the 17th century.[396] Works and pieces composed by Italian composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Rossini, Bellini, Verdi, and Puccini, are among the most famous and performed across the world. La Scala opera house in Milan is renowned as one of the best in the world.\\n\\njazz gained a strong foothold in Italy, and remained popular despite xenophobic policies of the Fascists. Italy was represented in the\\n\\nprogressive rock and pop movements of the 1970s, with bands such as\\n\\nPFM,\\n\\nBanco del Mutuo Soccorso,\\n\\nLe Orme,\\n\\nGoblin, and\\n\\nPooh.\\n\\n[397]\\n\\ncinema of Italy, and\\n\\nCinecittà films included complex scores by composers including\\n\\nEnnio Morricone.

A popular Italian genre, the Telefoni Bianchi, consisted of comedies with glamorous backgrounds.[410] Calligrafismo was a sharp contrast to the Telefoni Bianchi-American style comedies and is rather artistic, highly formalistic, expressive in complexity, and deals mainly with contemporary literary material.[411] Cinema was used by Mussolini, who founded Rome\\'s renowned Cinecittà studio, for the production of Fascist propaganda.[412]\\n\\n[413]\\n\\nItalian film directors include\\n\\nVittorio De Sica,\\n\\nFederico Fellini,\\n\\nSergio Leone,\\n\\nPier Paolo Pasolini,\\n\\nLuchino Visconti,\\n\\nMichelangelo Antonioni and\\n\\nRoberto Rossellini, recognised among the greatest of all time.\\n\\n[414]\\n\\nBicycle Thieves\\n\\nLa Dolce Vita\\n\\n8½\\n\\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\n\\nOnce Upon a Time in the West\\n\\nItalian neorealism, reflecting the poor condition of post-war Italy.\\n\\n[415]\\n\\nAs the country grew wealthier in the 1950s, a form of neorealism known as pink neorealism succeeded, and the commedia all\\'italiana genre and other film genres, such as sword-and-sandal and spaghetti Westerns, were popular in the 1960s and 70s.[416] Actresses such as Sophia Loren achieved international stardom. Erotic Italian thrillers, or gialli, produced by directors such as Dario Argento in the 1970s, influenced horror.[417] Recently, the Italian scene has received only occasional attention, with movies such as Cinema Paradiso, Life Is Beautiful and Il Postino: The Postman.[418]\\n\\nCinecittà studio is the largest film and television production facility in Europe,[419] where many international box office hits were filmed. In the 1950s, the number of international productions made there led to Rome\\'s being dubbed \"Hollywood on the Tiber\". More than 3,000 productions have been made on its lot, of which 90 received an Academy Award nomination, with 47 wins.[420] Italy is the most awarded country at the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, with 14 wins and 3 Special Awards.[421] As of 2016[update], Italian films have won 12 Palmes d\\'Or,[422] 11 Golden Lions,[423] and 7 Golden Bears.[424]\\n\\nSport\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nSport in Italy\\n\\nThe Azzurri in 2012.\\n\\nFootball is the most popular sport in Italy.\\n\\nThe most popular sport is football.[425] Italy\\'s team is one of the most successful, with four World Cup victories (1934, 1938, 1982, and 2006) and two UEFA Euro victories (1968 and 2020).[426] Italian clubs have won 48 major European trophies, making Italy the second most successful country in Europe, after Spain. Italy\\'s top league is Serie A and is followed by millions of fans around the world.[427]\\n\\nOther popular team sports include basketball, volleyball, and rugby.[428] Italy\\'s male and female national volleyball teams are often featured among the world\\'s best. The men\\'s team won three consecutive World Championships (in 1990, 1994 and 1998). Italy men\\'s basketball team\\'s best results were gold at EuroBasket 1983 and 1999, and silver at the 2004 Olympics. Lega Basket Serie A is one of the most competitive in Europe.[429] The Italy national rugby union team competes in the Six Nations Championship, and at the Rugby World Cup.\\n\\nItaly has a long and successful tradition in individual sports. Bicycle racing is popular;[430] Italians have won the UCI World Championships more than any other country, except Belgium. The Giro d\\'Italia is a cycling race held every May and one of the three Grand Tours. Alpine skiing is a widespread sport, and the country is a popular skiing destination.[431] Italian skiers achieve good results in Winter Olympic Games and the Alpine Ski World Cup. Tennis has a significant following: the fourth most practised sport.[432] The Rome Masters, founded in 1930, is one of the most prestigious tennis tournaments.[433] Italian players won the Davis Cup in 1976 and the Fed Cup in 2006, 2009, 2010, and 2013.\\n\\nFerrari SF21 by\\n\\nScuderia Ferrari, the\\n\\nmost successful Formula One team\\n\\nMotorsports are popular.[428] Italy has won, by far, the most MotoGP World Championships. Italian Scuderia Ferrari is the oldest surviving team in Grand Prix racing,[434] competing since 1948, and the most successful Formula One team with 232 wins. The Italian Grand Prix of Formula One has been held since 1921[435] always at Autodromo Nazionale Monza (except 1980).[436] Other successful Italian car manufacturers in motorsports are Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Maserati, and Fiat.[437]\\n\\nItaly has been successful in the Olympics, taking part from the first Olympiad and in 47 Games out of 48 (not 1904).[438] Italians have won 618 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, and 141 at the Winter Olympics, with 259 golds, the sixth most successful for total medals. The country hosted Winter Olympics in 1956 and 2006, and will host another in 2026; and a Summer games in 1960.\\n\\nFashion and design\\n\\nMain articles: \\n\\nItalian fashion and\\n\\nItalian design\\n\\nPrada shop at\\n\\nGalleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan\\n\\nItalian fashion has a long tradition. Top Global Fashion Capital Rankings (2013) by Global Language Monitor, ranked Rome sixth and Milan twelfth.[439] Major Italian fashion labels—such as Gucci, Armani, Prada, Versace, Valentino, Dolce & Gabbana—are among the finest fashion houses in the world. Jewellers such as Bulgari, Damiani, and Buccellati were founded in Italy. The fashion magazine Vogue Italia is one of the most prestigious fashion magazines in the world.[440]\\n\\nItaly is prominent in the field of design: notably interior, architectural, industrial, and urban designs. The country has produced well-known furniture designers, and Italian phrases such as Bel Disegno and Linea Italiana have entered the vocabulary of furniture design.[441] Examples of classic pieces of Italian white goods and pieces of furniture include Zanussi\\'s washing machines and refrigerators,[442] and the \"New Tone\" sofas by Atrium.[442] Milan and Turin are the nation\\'s leaders in architectural and industrial design. The city of Milan hosts Fiera Milano, Europe\\'s largest design fair.[443] Milan hosts major design- and architecture-related events and venues, such as the Fuori Salone and the Milan Furniture Fair, and has been home to the designers Bruno Munari, Lucio Fontana, Enrico Castellani, and Piero Manzoni.[444]\\n\\nCuisine\\n\\nMain articles: \\n\\nItalian cuisine and\\n\\nItalian meal structure\\n\\nspaghetti with tomato and\\n\\nbasil sauce\\n\\nItalian wine and\\n\\nsalumi\\n\\nItalian cuisine has developed through social and political changes, with roots as far back as the 4th century BC. The cuisine is heavily influenced by Etruscan, ancient Greek, ancient Roman, Byzantine, Arabic, and Jewish cuisines.[445] Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World, with items such as potatoes, tomatoes, and maize becoming main ingredients from the 18th century.[446] Italian cuisine is noted for its regional diversity,[447] abundance of difference in taste, and as one of the most popular in the world,[448] wielding strong influence abroad.[449]\\n\\nThe Mediterranean diet forms the basis of Italian cuisine, which is rich in pasta, fish, fruits, and vegetables and characterised by its simplicity and variety, with many dishes having only four to eight ingredients.[450] Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than elaborate preparation.[451] Dishes and recipes are often derivatives from local and familial tradition rather than created by chefs; so, many recipes are ideally suited for home cooking, this is the main reason behind the popularity of Italian cuisine from America[452] to Asia.[453]\\n\\nEU law.\\n\\n[454]\\n\\nCheese,\\n\\ncold cuts, and\\n\\nwine are central to Italian cuisine, with regional declinations and\\n\\nProtected Designation of Origin or\\n\\nProtected Geographical Indication labels, along with pizza and coffee forming part of\\n\\ngastronomic culture.\\n\\n[455]\\n\\nmascarpone and\\n\\nricotta or exotic tastes such as cocoa, vanilla, and cinnamon.\\n\\nGelato,\\n\\n[456]\\n\\ntiramisu,\\n\\n[457]\\n\\ncassata are among the most famous examples of Italian desserts, cakes, and patisserie.\\n\\nThe Italian meal structure is typical of the Mediterranean region and differs from North, Central, and East European meal structures, though it still often consists of breakfast (colazione), lunch (pranzo), and dinner (cena).[458] However, much less emphasis is placed on breakfast, which is often skipped or involves lighter portions than are seen in non-Mediterranean Western countries.[459] Late-morning and mid-afternoon snacks, called merenda (pl.: merende), are often included in this structure.[460]\\n\\nThe marketing strategy using words, images, color combinations (like the Italian tricolor), and geographical references evocative of Italy to promote non-Italian agri-food products is known as Italian Sounding.[461]\\n\\nPublic holidays, festivals and folklore\\n\\nMain articles: \\n\\nPublic holidays in Italy,\\n\\nTraditions of Italy, and\\n\\nFolklore of Italy\\n\\nFrecce Tricolori\\n\\nnational colours of Italy, during the celebrations of the\\n\\nFesta della Repubblica\\n\\nPublic holidays include religious, national, and regional observances. Italy\\'s National Day, the Festa della Repubblica (Republic Day),[462] is celebrated on 2 June , with the main celebration taking place in Rome, and commemorates the birth of the Italian Republic in 1946.[463] The ceremony includes deposition of a wreath as a tribute to the Italian Unknown Soldier by the President and a military parade.\\n\\nThe Saint Lucy\\'s Day, on 13 December, is popular among children in some Italian regions, where she plays a role similar to Santa Claus.[464] The Epiphany is associated with the folklore figure of Befana, a broomstick-riding old woman who, on the night of 5 January, brings good children gifts, and bad ones charcoal, or bags of ashes.[465] The Assumption of Mary coincides with Ferragosto on 15 August, the summer vacation period which may be a long weekend or most of the month.[466] The Italian national patronal day, on 4 October, celebrates Saints Francis and Catherine. Each city or town also celebrates a public holiday on the festival of the local patron saint, [463] e.g. Rome on 29 June (Saints Peter and Paul).\\n\\nPalio di Siena horse race,\\n\\nHoly Week rites,\\n\\nSaracen Joust of Arezzo and the\\n\\nCalcio Fiorentino.

A permanent association, with most of the local tribes and cities, was formed, and Rome began the conquest of Western Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. In the wake of Julius Caesar's assassination in 44 BC, Rome grew into a massive empire stretching from Britain to the borders of Persia, engulfing the whole Mediterranean basin, in which Greek, Roman, and other cultures merged into a powerful civilisation. The long reign of the first emperor, Augustus, began an age of peace and prosperity. Roman Italy remained the metropole of the empire, homeland of the Romans and territory of the capital.[55]\",\n",

The invasion of another Germanic tribe in the 6th century, the Lombards, reduced Byzantine presence and ended political unity of the peninsula for the next 1,300 years.

Until the 13th century, politics was dominated by relations between the Holy Roman Emperors and the Papacy, with city-states siding with the former (Ghibellines) or with the latter (Guelphs) for momentary advantage.[61] The Germanic emperor and Roman pontiff became the universal powers of medieval Europe. However, conflict over the Investiture Controversy and between Guelphs and Ghibellines ended the imperial-feudal system in the north, where cities gained independence.[62] In 1176, the Lombard League of city-states, defeated Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, ensuring their independence.',\n",

They were independent thalassocratic city-states, in which merchants had considerable power. Although oligarchical, the relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement.[64] The best-known maritime republics were Venice, Genoa, Pisa, and Amalfi.[65] Each had dominion over overseas lands, islands, lands on the Adriatic, Aegean, and Black seas, and commercial colonies in the Near East and North Africa.[66]',\n",

Italian polities were now regional states effectively ruled by princes, in control of trade and administration, and their courts became centres of the arts and sciences. The Italian princedoms represented the first modern states, as opposed to feudal monarchies and empires. The princedoms were led by political dynasties and merchant families, such as the Medici in Florence.[69][70] The Renaissance was fostered by the wealth accumulated by merchant cities and patronage of its dominant families.[69] The Italian Renaissance exercised a dominant influence on European art for centuries, with artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael, Giotto, Donatello, and Titian, and architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi, Andrea Palladio, and Donato Bramante.',\n",
