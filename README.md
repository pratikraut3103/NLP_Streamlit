# NLP Summarizer and Q&A Interface

Welcome to the NLP Summarizer and Q&A Interface project! This project leverages Natural Language Processing techniques to extract, summarize, and interact with textual content from various sources, including websites.

## Project Overview

This project provides a user-friendly interface where you can input a website link, summarize the content, and ask questions about the summarized information. The tool is built using Langchain and Streamlit to ensure accurate and efficient processing.

## Features

- **Text Extraction**: Extract text from various document formats such as CSVs, PDFs, and websites.
- **Data Chunking**: Split the extracted data into manageable chunks for processing.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Convert data chunks into vector embeddings for efficient querying.
- **Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of the extracted content.
- **Q&A Interface**: Ask questions about the summarized content and receive accurate responses.

## Technologies Used

- **Langchain**: For text processing and NLP tasks.
- **Streamlit**: For building an interactive user interface.
